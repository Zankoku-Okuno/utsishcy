Voiceless non-rhotic liquid at the start of a word? Probably gets voiced.

Coronals are probably dental wherever they constrast with palatals.

The voiceless liquids are produced with slightly more friction than the voiced versions, but not enough to qualify then as true fricatives.

Since unvoiced/voiced was once aspirated/unaspirated, it makes quite a bit of sense to devoice final stops, but to retain clear aspiration on final unvoiced stops.

Vowels between voiceless fricatives were elided with compensatory voicing of the second fricative.
Therefore: fz, xz, xv...
Not all weird onset clusters were created this way.
Though, this might also apply for some [affricate]V[obstruent] sequences, obtaining tʃt.


Adjacent stops are disallowed.
If the do come together morphologically, then the first stop is lenited to the corresponding fricative.

`[+stop, +palatal] > [-palatal] / {ʃ,ʒ,ʃ'}`.
E.g. `c > k / ʃ_` and `{c,ɟ} > g / ʒ_`.
In fact, I may have the distinction b/t palatal and velar disappear in several contexts.
However, /ʃ/&c really do stay [ʃ]: they were presumably the pioneers of the dorsal fronting.
I guess that only leaves the stops (I'm thinking ʎ wasn't ʟ, but we'll see).

The space for voiced velar stops is available, so I should expect ɟ~g and k~g, at least in context.
If regularity of voicing distinctions kicks back in mentally, then the absence of /g/ might be an accident and still exist in loanwords (in isolation: voicing alternations could make it devoice anyway).
Similarly for /p', f'/, but what loanwords will those be in‽
Since /ʀ/ still patterns as ʁ and presumably now shares space with ɣ, I don't think those phonemic spaces will be available for loans.

The unvoiced stops are phonetically aspirated, though the feature is not contrastive.
I get the feeling that this is because unaspriated stops became implosive.
This is following the analysis of non-explosive stops as being marked by not having a positive pressure buildup.
See ["Explosives, Implosives, and Nonexplosives: the Linguistic Function of Air Pressure Differences in Stops" by George N. Clements](http://nickclements.free.fr/publications/2002a.pdf).
Presumably, aspirated stops are characterized by a larger pressure buildup than unaspirated, and those features could shift to have the bias ("center of pressure buildup") be more neutral.
I.e. both kinds of stops have lost some pressure, but current implosives are still characterized by having a lower pressure than unvoiced stops.
From this, I expect word-final stops are aspirated for unvoiced, but unaspirated & devoiced for voiced.

Since /ʀ/ could be difficult in some circumstances or for some speakers, I'll let ʀ~ʁ.
I'm not sure if it should be pure free alternation, or if there's also some conditioned cases where the trill sounds like overdoing it.
Well, rapid speach has a habit of leniting trills, so...


TODO:
I'm being pulled in two different directions for allophony for a.
I'd like e, æ (French-ish a), and ə, but the ways I'm thinking of getting them are ɛ~e, a~ə, and a~æ.
Really, it's that I want fronting umlaut and raising umlaut, but having both is too much.
One option I've got is fronting back vowels immediately after palatal consonants only and ignoring any harmony considerations; that could lead to front rounded sounds, which I'm not sure I really want, not without trying some words.
That still leaves the question of ɛ~e open, though.
Maybe merely ɛ > e in stressed syllables?
I still don't have schwa, but is that such a loss?, or I could get it back in unstressed open syllables at the end of prosodic words.
