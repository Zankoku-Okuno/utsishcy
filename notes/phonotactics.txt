## phonotactic processes

a liquid second-to-last in the coda moves to the end of the coda at the end of a word

Consecutive vowels are separated by glottal stop if the second is stressed or h if the second is unstressed.
Then, if the second is unstressed and followed by an unvoiced consonant, that vowel is whispered.

nasals not allowed with stops in the onset



## allophony


TODO: Palatal consonants and back rounded vowels are going to interact.
My first instinct is to back palatals to velars after rounded vowels; perhaps before is better, maybe both?

/ʃ/ is normally lamino-postalveolar, but after back vowels, is becomes apico-.
Also, /ʃ~ç/.

`[+stop, +palatal] > [-palatal] / {ʃ,ʒ,ʃ'}`.
E.g. `c > k / ʃ_` and `{c,ɟ} > g / ʒ_`.
In fact, I may have the distinction b/t palatal and velar disappear in several contexts.
However, /ʃ/&c really do stay [ʃ]: they were presumably the pioneers of the dorsal fronting.
I guess that only leaves the stops (I'm thinking ʎ wasn't ʟ, but we'll see).


Voiceless non-rhotic liquid at the start of a word? Probably gets voiced.
















Vowels between voiceless fricatives were elided with compensatory voicing of the second fricative.
Therefore: fz, xz, xv...
Not all weird onset clusters were created this way.
Though, this might also apply for some [affricate]V[obstruent] sequences, obtaining tʃt.


The space for voiced velar stops is available, so I should expect ɟ~g and k~g, at least in context.
If regularity of voicing distinctions kicks back in mentally, then the absence of /g/ might be an accident and still exist in loanwords (in isolation: voicing alternations could make it devoice anyway).
Similarly for /p', f'/, but what loanwords will those be in‽
Since /ʀ/ still patterns as ʁ and presumably now shares space with ɣ, I don't think those phonemic spaces will be available for loans.


Since /ʀ/ could be difficult in some circumstances or for some speakers, I'll let ʀ~ʁ.
I'm not sure if it should be pure free alternation, or if there's also some conditioned cases where the trill sounds like overdoing it.
Well, rapid speach has a habit of leniting trills, so...


TODO:
I'm being pulled in two different directions for allophony for a.
I'd like e, æ (French-ish a), and ə, but the ways I'm thinking of getting them are ɛ~e, a~ə, and a~æ.
Really, it's that I want fronting umlaut and raising umlaut, but having both is too much.
One option I've got is fronting back vowels immediately after palatal consonants only and ignoring any harmony considerations; that could lead to front rounded sounds, which I'm not sure I really want, not without trying some words.
That still leaves the question of ɛ~e open, though.
Maybe merely ɛ > e in stressed syllables?
I still don't have schwa, but is that such a loss?, or I could get it back in unstressed open syllables at the end of prosodic words.


I expect /ɛ/ to be most likely to be used in an ``um'' paramorpheme, followed by /a, i/.
I've decided this based on Japanese ``ano'', ``edo''; nothing fancy, just the one language I know how to translate English ``um'' into.







Just playing around with the sounds, I'm thinking about ɨ→ə, but on looking up that process, it seems a bit uncommon.
Many changes in Index Diachronica take ɨ→i,e.
On PBase, just under 5% of changes from ɨ end up at ə, and all those rules seem to be reducing a ton of vowels indiscriminately.
There's nothing ɨ→ɘ in PBase, but I think that makes sense in my phonology (better than →ə).
Nevertheless: BE BOLD!
