Phonotactics


Voiceless non-rhotic liquid at the start of a word? Probably gets voiced.

Coronals are probably dental wherever they constrast with palatals.

The voiceless liquids are produced with slightly more friction than the voiced versions, but not enough to qualify then as true fricatives.

Since unvoiced/voiced was once aspirated/unaspirated, it makes quite a bit of sense to devoice final stops, but to retain clear aspiration on final unvoiced stops.

Vowels between voiceless fricatives were elided with compensatory voicing of the second fricative.
Therefore: fz, xz, xv...
Not all weird onset clusters were created this way.
Though, this might also apply for some [affricate]V[obstruent] sequences, obtaining t Ét.


Adjacent stops are disallowed.
If the do come together morphologically, then the first stop is lenited to the corresponding fricative.
