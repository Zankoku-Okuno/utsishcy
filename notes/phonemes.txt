Rationalizations

TODO: investigate the uses of voiceless laterals in natlangs more

TODO: contrastive hierarchy


TODO: think about tones.
I see that the WALS data shows that languages with implosives tend to have simple tone systems, much more than if the language had ejectives only or no glottalization at all.


I'm making the call that p' isn't a thing.
Essentially, it just adds some symmetry with the lack of f', while at the same time reinforcing a very natural assymmetry; namely that ejectives are hard and the front and implosives are hard at the back.

Basically, I like the uvular trill from French (and some accents of German and Dutch).
Therefore, I let the voiced uvular fricative turn to ʀ before fronting of the dorsal consonants.

I've decided not to include phonemic affricates, even though they perhaps normally would be included in languages that allow word-initial /tʃt-/.
The thing is, not only are stop-fricative clusters allowed with homogenous places of articulation, but also at heterogenous places: /dv/, /tx/, /ks/, /kʃ/, /ps/, &c.
Similarly, I've ignored palatalization and labialization; rather, I've interpreted it as a realization of clustering with j and w respectively.
These processes can occur on just about every consonant, so it's not worth exploding the consonant inventory.

I wasn't sold on lateral fricatives, but after seeing Tlingit, I figured: why not have a bunch of laterals?
I decided on having voiceless laterals as a kind of "less intense" lateral fricative.
All the same, the voiceless laterals might be in free alternation with the fricatives: l̥~ɬ, ʎ̥~ʎ̝̊ (and can I just state for the record how infuriating it is not to have a curlycued ʎ!).

The liquids, especially the devoiced ones (r̥ l̥ ʎ̥ j̊), are generally pronounced with slightly more friction than usual, but not enough to qualify them as even halfway to fricative.
The bilabial approximant w patterns oddly: it appears only to labialize other consonants (except for ejectives, nasals, and r̥/r).


In the design of the liquids, I saw that many languages, even with massive consonant inventories, only have r l j w h.
In my case, I knew I wanted two rhotics because Junen Rha, Chechen, and Czech all do, and I already had four laterals.
I'm still chasing the pronounciation of Czech r, so some of that may yet enter the language: perhaps /r̝̊/?
I think not having the Czech distinction in rhotics, it'd be nicer to leave it unique anyway: even if I add a lot of friction, I'll leave it unvoiced.

About h, I see a lot of languages use h and friends as replacements for x and friends.
Only a few (Kabardian, Chechen, Shixing, and Arabic in my quick search) seem to have a well-developed, independent ecosystem of radical consonants --- even fewer that click languages.
Given that Ukrainian doesn't have h, I'm not a fan of debuccalization, and I'm even less attached to the glottal stop in this language, I decided against any glottals.
On the other hand, I did still want a kind of coda h sound, but I think I'm going to get that from my voiceless liquids.






What's wrong with Russian vowels?
I'll go with them, even though Ukrainian has ɪ in place of ɨ, since I want to get better at ɨ, and don't really want to reinforce the i/ɪ separation that seems to come up a lot in my conlanging thought process.

TODO:
I think whispered vowels aren't going to be a thing.
If they were going to be there, the consonant clusters would get all the more pronounced by their deletion.
Perhaps a bit of "umlaut" could be left behind by these whispered/deleted vowels which could get noticed in the inflectional morphology.





Stress is marked primarily with length.
It is fixed to the first syllable; secondary stress falls every other syllable.
TODO: Now, the thing is, if I have prefixes, should the stress move?
If it does shift, could that undo old stress-conditioned sound changes or bring back old unstress-conditioned changes?
TODO: poetry might be affected by historical syllables (deleted vowels still count towards syllable counts), or I might say the "poetical" "tradition" is novel and so uses just that current form of the language.

I'm trying to think how (if many clusters with plosives, fricatives, and affricates came from vowel deletion) to maintain _some_ vowels between these sounds.
If the vowel deletion were conditioned by lexical stress, that could prevent the cluster apocalypse.
Unstressed inter-obstruent vowels before a stressed syllable are devoiced, then deleted?
Do I want to occaisionally have a word keep its lexical stress, or is that just kitchen-sinking?

wow: when I got to doing my contrastive hierarchy, I discoverd I _do_ have semivowels /◌ʷ,◌ʲ/ and /◌ʲ/ constrasts with /j/!

I faced a decision with marking back or front vowels.
I decided to go with back as marked: fronting happened in the dorsal consonants, so I guess the tongue posture moved forward.
Importantly, with back and high both marked, I know the tongue posture is likely to be front and low.
This also makes it easier to pronounce /a/ as in French just as a matter of normalcy.
Hey, since labial is marked, I can also have the default lip posture be more tense than protruded.
